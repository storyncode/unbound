# Bound by Trouble

- We all wake up, on a table for experimentation
- "That has to be right, that has to be right." A man typing at a keyboard repeats.
- We wake up once more on a straw bed in a stone chamber, unbound, can hear one person in each room.
- A man is waiting outside our doors beside chairs and asks us to sit.
- He informs us he will be teaching us, and explains that trauma often causes the awakening.
- We may not leave until we can use our powers properly.
- The magi in front of us is "independent" - whatever that means.
- We can alter the laws of reality with our powers.
- Spheres are the different types of magic
- There is an affinity to one, but should have a broad range of knowledge of the spheres
- Arete is "magical lifeblood" - we should cultivate more of this if possible.
- Name of the mage we are speaking to is Albert
